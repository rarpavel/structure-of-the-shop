## Architecture Description

### API
Each file in the `api` directory is responsible for interacting with a specific aspect of business logic (e.g., handling product data, categories, orders, etc.). This allows for easy scalability and updates to API interactions without altering the user interface.

### Components
Components that define the visual representation and interactivity for users are isolated in their own folder. This facilitates code reuse and ease of updates to individual parts of the UI.

### Context
Using React Context allows for managing the global state of the application, essential for storing data about users, orders, and products without reloading the page and without excess server requests.

### Pages
Page components are used to organize the main user areas, such as viewing products or managing orders. Depending on the chosen route, they provide the appropriate functionality for each operation that a user can perform in the web shop.

## Advantages

- **Separation of Business Logic from UI:** API and contexts allow for isolating logic from the user interface, facilitating flexibility and ease of testing.
- **Modularity:** The component structure allows for easy addition, removal, or modification of functional elements without impacting the rest of the system.
- **Scalability:** The structure supports expansion, such as adding new payment systems or delivery methods, thanks to the ease of integrating new APIs and components.

## Design Pattern Used

The design pattern employed here is primarily the Repository Pattern for the API interactions, which abstracts the data layer and allows the application to treat the API calls as a collection of data operations. This pattern is crucial for ensuring that data access is standardized and that the business logic can operate independently of the data source.

This pattern, coupled with React Context for state management, ensures that the components remain clean and focused on their roles without being cluttered with logic to manage state or handle API calls directly. This separation of concerns makes the codebase more maintainable and easier to extend or modify.
